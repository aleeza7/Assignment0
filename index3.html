  <h1> Best Songs</h1>
  <h2> From Each Album</h2>
  <br>
 <h2> ‘Video Games’ – Born to Die </h2>
Born to Die put Del Rey on the map, introducing her to the mainstream as a figure of tragic glamour, melancholia and Americana. With a distinctively crafted aesthetic and a rich visual world curated through her lyrics and repeated motifs, Del Rey found immense popularity online, becoming a Tumblr icon in the early 2010s. The album’s appeal lies in Del Rey’s baroque pop approach, creating effortlessly catchy songs while exploring dense topics such as loneliness and toxic relationships.

However, the song that started it all and allowed the album to find a large audience was ‘Video Games’. The song was released in 2011, with Del Rey’s homemade music video, which included webcam clips and vintage videos spliced together, going viral on YouTube. The mellow track is stunning, with Del Rey reminiscing on a specific time in her life with vulnerability. As harps sweep across the soundscape, Del Rey expresses her love for a man that she knows doesn’t love her the same way she loves him. 


<h2>‘Ride’ – Paradise </h2>
Paradise emerged a few months after Born to Die, acting somewhat as a continuation of the record. Although it’s technically an EP, there’s no way we couldn’t include the eight-song collection on the list because it contains some of the most magnificent songs Del Rey has ever released. A few of these tracks formed the soundtrack to her 2013 short film Tropico, including the rapturous ‘Body Electric’ and the sexually-charged ‘Gods and Monsters’.

Many of the cuts on Paradise are bolder and more lyrically daring, like ‘Cola’, which features her iconic opening line, “My pussy tastes like Pepsi Cola”. But it is ‘Ride’ that makes Paradise such a spectacular EP. The emotional song feels like an encapsulation of everything Del Rey had endured up until that point. Starting slow, ‘Ride’ accelerates with fleeting strings as Del Rey declares with desperation, “I’m tired of feeling like I’m fucking crazy/ I’m tired of driving ’til I see stars in my eyes”. It remains one of the best songs she’s ever made. 


<h2>‘Shades of Cool’ – Ultraviolence</h2>
Ultraviolence is one of Del Rey’s best works, making many fans wish for her to return to heavier rock-oriented influences. Co-produced by The Black Keys’ Dan Auerbach, the album features hazy psychedelic guitars, with Del Rey calling it “west coast-driven”. In Ultraviolence, Del Rey explores complicated relationships against a background of bars, beaches and parties. There’s even a gorgeous rendition of Nina Simone’s ‘The Other Woman’, with Del Rey situating herself as the titular character. 

Many impressive lyrics, guitar riffs and melodies can be enjoyed on Ultraviolence, but ‘Shades of Cool’ stands strong with Del Rey’s rich lyrical depictions of a complex lover. She completely immerses the listener in this man’s dark, melancholic world infused with drugs and women. Despite her love for him, she knows she can’t “fix” his behaviour and be his only one. One of Del Rey’s best bridges can be found here, with circling guitars wrapping up her voice as she mumbles lines about him slipping away. 


<h2>‘The Blackest Day’ – Honeymoon</h2>
Honeymoon is arguably Del Rey’s most underrated album, containing some of her most beautiful yet rarely discussed songs. Over 14 tracks, Del Rey sings about doomed relationships, media pressures, and eating soft ice cream with an Italian lover, with lush strings accompanying her every move. However, the album also incorporates trap influences in songs such as ‘Freak’ and ‘High By The Beach’, creating an addictive dichotomy between old and new influences. 

The album’s standout song is hard to pick, but ‘The Blackest Day’ takes the cake with its journey through devastating heartbreak. Del Rey sings about missing her boyfriend, who has left her, making her feeling empty and worthless. Now, she looks for love “in all the wrong places” and listens to Billie Holiday as she grapples with her loneliness and misery, all while strings and trap-inspired beats collide. 


<h2>‘Tomorrow Never Came’ – Lust for Life </h2>
Del Rey’s 2017 effort Lust for Life featured a wealth of duets, something she had not explored on any previous records. With contributions from big stars from A$AP Rocky to Stevie Nicks, the album has something for everyone, from a hip-hop-infused summer anthem to a gentle folk-inspired ballad. There are many unforgettable moments in Lust for Life, although it’s perhaps not her most cohesive record. 

Still, Lust for Life‘s broad sonic palette clearly reflects the breadth of emotions that come with being human, with Del Rey celebrating the good and the bad. One of the album’s strongest songs, ‘Tomorrow Never Came’, a collaboration with Sean Ono Lennon, is a heartbreaking tale of unrequited love, with simple yet tragic lines like, “You said you’d love me like no tomorrow/ I guess tomorrow never came”.


<h2>‘Mariner’s Apartment Complex’ – Norman Fucking Rockwell</h2>
2019’s Norman Fucking Rockwell is often cited as one of Del Rey’s greatest albums – and for good reason. The record is one of her most cohesive, with instrumentation bearing soft rock, desert rock, psychedelia and folk influences. Moreover, the album contains some of the singer’s most robust lyricism, vividly depicting heartbreak, happiness and nostalgia. 

Cuts like the ten-minute sun-drenched ‘Venice Bitch’ and the sweet ‘Bartender’ are just some of many album highlights, but it’s perhaps ‘Mariner’s Apartment Complex’ that reigns supreme. The song details a relationship where Del Rey has the strength to be her lover’s guide, using imagery of the sea, assuring, “You lose your way, just take my hand”. The sprawling guitars have a dreamy, Californian sensibility, which perfectly accompanies Del Rey’s exploration of hopefulness. 


<h2> ‘Yosemite’ – Chemtrails Over the Country Club </h2>
Without a doubt, Chemtrails Over the Country Club is Del Rey’s weakest record, with ballads such as ‘Let Me Love You Like A Woman’ and ‘Not All Who Wander Are Lost’ quickly tiring. The album, released in 2021, feels rather monotonous due to its lack of musical variation, with Del Rey and producer Jack Antonoff sliding into the comfortability of familiarity. Although there are many lovely melodies and vocal performances, the songs often appear to blend into one.

The album still has its brilliant moments, like the moody ‘Dark But Just A Game’ and the poignant duet ‘Breaking Up Slowly’, featuring Nikki Lane. However, the best song on Chemtrails is arguably ‘Yosemite’, a gentle folk-inspired cut mainly led by acoustic guitar. Del Rey’s voice shines as she sings lines such as “Honey, you make me feel invincible/ It’s just like I wanted”.


<h2>‘Thunder’ – Blue Banisters</h2>
After the disappointing Chemtrails Over the Country Club, Del Rey redeemed herself with Blue Banisters a few months later, which she teased on Twitter with the words, “I’m writing my own story. And no one can tell it but me”. The personal album addresses controversies Del Rey has faced in her career and celebrates her family and friends. For example, ‘Sweet Carolina’ is a love letter to her sister and ‘Living Legend’ is an ode to her friend and mentor, Jane Powers. 

While Blue Banisters has many stellar moments, including ‘Dealer’, a duet with Miles Kane and the lullaby-esque ‘Cherry Blossom’, ‘Thunder’ is one of the record’s most essential numbers. Originally created as part of an unfulfilled collaboration album with The Last Shadow Puppets, the song contains beautiful strings and upbeat percussion, which retains a sense of optimism as Del Rey reckons with a failing relationship.
