 <h2> ‘Video Games’ – Born to Die </h2>
<p>

The song that started it all and allowed the album to find a large audience was ‘Video Games’. The song was released in 2011, with Del Rey’s homemade music video, which included webcam clips and vintage videos spliced together, going viral on YouTube. The mellow track is stunning, with Del Rey reminiscing on a specific time in her life with vulnerability. As harps sweep across the soundscape, Del Rey expresses her love for a man that she knows doesn’t love her the same way she loves him. 

</p>

<h2>‘Ride’ – Paradise </h2>
<p>

<p>Many of the cuts on Paradise are bolder and more lyrically daring, like ‘Cola’, which features her iconic opening line, “My pussy tastes like Pepsi Cola”. But it is ‘Ride’ that makes Paradise such a spectacular EP. The emotional song feels like an encapsulation of everything Del Rey had endured up until that point. Starting slow, ‘Ride’ accelerates with fleeting strings as Del Rey declares with desperation, “I’m tired of feeling like I’m fucking crazy/ I’m tired of driving ’til I see stars in my eyes”. It remains one of the best songs she’s ever made. 
</p>

<h2>‘Shades of Cool’ – Ultraviolence</h2>
  <p>

Many impressive lyrics, guitar riffs and melodies can be enjoyed on Ultraviolence, but ‘Shades of Cool’ stands strong with Del Rey’s rich lyrical depictions of a complex lover. She completely immerses the listener in this man’s dark, melancholic world infused with drugs and women. Despite her love for him, she knows she can’t “fix” his behaviour and be his only one. One of Del Rey’s best bridges can be found here, with circling guitars wrapping up her voice as she mumbles lines about him slipping away. 
</p>

<h2>‘The Blackest Day’ – Honeymoon</h2>
  <p>

The album’s standout song is hard to pick, but ‘The Blackest Day’ takes the cake with its journey through devastating heartbreak. Del Rey sings about missing her boyfriend, who has left her, making her feeling empty and worthless. Now, she looks for love “in all the wrong places” and listens to Billie Holiday as she grapples with her loneliness and misery, all while strings and trap-inspired beats collide. 

</p>
<h2>‘Tomorrow Never Came’ – Lust for Life </h2>
  <p>

 Lust for Life‘s broad songs clearly reflects the breadth of emotions that come with being human, with Del Rey celebrating the good and the bad. One of the album’s strongest songs, ‘Tomorrow Never Came’, a collaboration with Sean Ono Lennon, is a heartbreaking tale of unrequited love, with simple yet tragic lines like, “You said you’d love me like no tomorrow/ I guess tomorrow never came”.
</p>

<h2>‘Mariner’s Apartment Complex’ – Norman Fucking Rockwell</h2>
<p>

Cuts like the ten-minute sun-drenched ‘Venice Bitch’ and the sweet ‘Bartender’ are just some of many album highlights, but it’s perhaps ‘Mariner’s Apartment Complex’ that reigns supreme. The song details a relationship where Del Rey has the strength to be her lover’s guide, using imagery of the sea, assuring, “You lose your way, just take my hand”. The sprawling guitars have a dreamy, Californian sensibility, which perfectly accompanies Del Rey’s exploration of hopefulness. 
</p>

<h2> ‘Yosemite’ – Chemtrails Over the Country Club </h2>
<p>

The album still has its brilliant moments, like the moody ‘Dark But Just A Game’ and the poignant duet ‘Breaking Up Slowly’, featuring Nikki Lane. However, the best song on Chemtrails is arguably ‘Yosemite’, a gentle folk-inspired cut mainly led by acoustic guitar. Del Rey’s voice shines as she sings lines such as “Honey, you make me feel invincible/ It’s just like I wanted”.
</p>

<h2>‘Thunder’ – Blue Banisters</h2>
<p>
While Blue Banisters has many stellar moments, including ‘Dealer’, a duet with Miles Kane and the lullaby-esque ‘Cherry Blossom’, ‘Thunder’ is one of the record’s most essential numbers. Originally created as part of an unfulfilled collaboration album with The Last Shadow Puppets, the song contains beautiful strings and upbeat percussion, which retains a sense of optimism as Del Rey reckons with a failing relationship.
