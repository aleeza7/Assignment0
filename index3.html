<p>

The song that begun it all and permitted the collection to discover a huge group of fans was ‘Video Games’.

</p>

<h2>‘Ride’ – Paradise </h2>
<p>

Many of the cuts on Ride are bolder and more expressively brave, like ‘Cola’, which highlights her famous opening line. But it is ‘Ride’ that creates Ride such a fabulous EP. The enthusiastic tune feels like an embodiment of everything Lana Del Rey had persevered up until that point. Beginning moderate, ‘Ride’ quickens with brief strings as Del Rey pronounces with franticness, “I’m tired of feeling like I’m f****** insane/ I’m tired of driving ’til I see stars in my eyes”.

<h2>‘Shades of Cool’ – Ultraviolence</h2>

<h2>‘The Blackest Day’ – Honeymoon</h2>
<p>


Numerous amazing verses, guitar riffs and tunes can be delighted in on Ultraviolence, but ‘Shades of Cool’ stands solid with Del Rey’s wealthy expressive portrayals of a complex partner. She totally drenches the audience in this man’s dull, melancholic world implanted with drugs and ladies.

  <p>

One of the album’s strongest songs, ‘Tomorrow Never Came’, a collaboration with Sean Ono Lennon, may be a deplorable story of lonely cherish, with straightforward however awful lines like, “You said you’d cherish me like no tomorrow/ I figure tomorrow never came”.</p>

<h2>‘Mariner’s Apartment Complex’ – Norman F******* Rockwell</h2>
<p>

It is maybe ‘Mariner’s Flat Complex’ that rules preeminent in this album. The melody subtle elements a relationship where Del Rey has the quality to be her lover’s direct, utilizing symbolism of the ocean, guaranteeing, “You lose your way, fair take my hand”. The sprawling guitars have a marvelous, Californian sensibility, which flawlessly goes with Del Rey’s investigation of confidence.
</p>
<h2> ‘Yosemite’ – Chemtrails Over the Country Club </h2>
<p>

The collection still has its brilliant minutes, just like the touchy ‘Dark But Fair A Game’ and the strong two part harmony ‘Breaking Up Slowly’, featuring Nikki Path. In any case, the leading tune on Chemtrails is ostensibly ‘Yosemite’, a delicate folk-inspired cut primarily driven by acoustic guitar. Del Rey’s voice sparkles as she sings lines such as “Honey, you make me feel invulnerable/ It’s rather like I wanted”.</p>

<h2>‘Thunder’ – Blue Banisters</h2>
<p>
'Thunder’ is one of the record’s most fundamental numbers.
