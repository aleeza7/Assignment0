      <h2>Born To Die (2012)</h2>  <img src ="btd.jpeg" alt="Born To Die Album Cover" width="159" height="150">
     <p>  A relationship you want to have and continue but you just can’t keep going because you are heading different directions in life. Themes of love, sacrifice, freedom, Americana and feeling content (in some songs) as well as wanting better (in others.) Born to Die put Del Rey on the map, introducing her to the mainstream as a figure of tragic glamour, melancholia and Americana. With a distinctively crafted aesthetic and a rich visual world curated through her lyrics and repeated motifs, Del Rey found immense popularity online, becoming a Tumblr icon in the early 2010s. The album’s appeal lies in Del Rey’s baroque pop approach, creating effortlessly catchy songs while exploring dense topics such as loneliness and toxic relationships.
</p>
  <p>Paradise Edition: The fall of man, freedom, the open road. Themes of freedom, an idyllic world and religion.  </p>
      
<h2>Ultraviolence (2014)</h2> <img src ="uv.jpeg" alt="Ultraviolence Album Cover" width="150" height="150">
      <p> Fragility, loose feeling/ jazz feeling. A possibly sardonic and partially ironic introspective. Themes of pain, being misunderstood, Cocaine, and the West Coast.Ultraviolence is one of Del Rey’s best works, making many fans wish for her to return to heavier rock-oriented influences. Co-produced by The Black Keys’ Dan Auerbach, the album features hazy psychedelic guitars, with Del Rey calling it “west coast-driven”. In Ultraviolence, Del Rey explores complicated relationships against a background of bars, beaches and parties. There’s even a gorgeous rendition of Nina Simone’s ‘The Other Woman’
 </p>
      
<h2>Honeymoon (2015)</h2> <img src ="hm.jpeg" alt="Honeymoon Album Cover" wwidth="150" height="150">
      <p> Solitude and hoping everything will turn out beautifully for you. Themes of Romance, loneliness, trying and desperation.Honeymoon is arguably Del Rey’s most underrated album, containing some of her most beautiful yet rarely discussed songs. Over 14 tracks, Del Rey sings about doomed relationships, media pressures, and eating soft ice cream with an Italian lover, with lush strings accompanying her every move. However, the album also incorporates trap influences in songs such as ‘Freak’ and ‘High By The Beach’, creating an addictive dichotomy between old and new influences. 
 </p>
      
      <h2>Lust For Life (2017)</h2> <img src ="lfl.jpeg" alt="Lust For Life Album Cover" width="150" height="150">
  <p> Not Happy but positive. The first album that really looks to today and not the past. A commentary on the political climate of today as well as a personal shift from what she’s done before. Themes of 70s hippie culture, impending doom as well as finding a place for yourself and love & freedom.Del Rey’s 2017 effort Lust for Life featured a wealth of duets, something she had not explored on any previous records. With contributions from big stars from A$AP Rocky to Stevie Nicks, the album has something for everyone, from a hip-hop-infused summer anthem to a gentle folk-inspired ballad. There are many unforgettable moments in Lust for Life, although it’s perhaps not her most cohesive record </p>

      <h2>Norman F******* Rockwell (2019)</h2>  <img src ="nfr.jpeg" alt="Norman F******* Rockwell Album Cover" width="150" height="150">
      <p> Being Misunderstood. Rock and roll is dead and the world is on fire but the record sounds like a nostalgic Americana ocean. Themes of being misunderstood, hope and finding happiness. The album is often cited as one of Del Rey’s greatest albums – and for good reason. The record is one of her most cohesive, with instrumentation bearing soft rock, desert rock, psychedelia and folk influences. Moreover, the album contains some of the singer’s most robust lyricism, vividly depicting heartbreak, happiness and nostalgia. 

 </p>

    <h2>Chemtrails Over The Country Club (2021) </h2> <img src ="cotc.jpeg" alt="Chemtrails Over The Country Club Album Cover" width="150" height="150">
        <p> Family and relationships. Finding people who make you feel understood and being your own person. Themes of self acceptance, looking forward, being sure of what you want and going for it and being wild and free.Without a doubt, Chemtrails Over the Country Club is Del Rey’s weakest record, with ballads such as ‘Let Me Love You Like A Woman’ and ‘Not All Who Wander Are Lost’ quickly tiring. The album, released in 2021, feels rather monotonous due to its lack of musical variation, with Del Rey and producer Jack Antonoff sliding into the comfortability of familiarity. Although there are many lovely melodies and vocal performances, the songs often appear to blend into one.  </p>

      <h2>Blue banisters (2021)</h2> <img src ="bb.jpeg" alt="Blue Banisters Album Cover" width="150" height="150">
      <p> Having people who support you. Loving yourself and who you’ve become. Having a good close group of people to love and be loved by. Themes of self love, friendship, family, being wild, not relying on a man to take care of you.After the disappointing Chemtrails Over the Country Club, Del Rey redeemed herself with Blue Banisters a few months later, which she teased on Twitter with the words, “I’m writing my own story. And no one can tell it but me”. The personal album addresses controversies Del Rey has faced in her career and celebrates her family and friends. For example, ‘Sweet Carolina’ is a love letter to her sister and ‘Living Legend’ is an ode to her friend and mentor, Jane Powers.   </p>
